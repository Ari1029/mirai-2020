## Cloning

The method of cloning does not really matter, though we'll outline how to clone using Git.
If you wish to download the raw .ZIP or using the GitHub CLI, that works too.

1. Install Git if you have not already.
2. Navigate to the directory you wish to clone to.  
   (Unfortunately, this is platform specific, so we can't help you here)  
   (Search online for how to navigate to a directory for your platform)  
3. Use `git clone https://github.com/Discobots-1104A/2020-2021-bionic-beaver.git` to clone our repository.

## Building

A CMake file will be created soon for cross-platform building.

## Contributing

We will try to setup pull request and issue templates to allow for others to contribute to the project.
